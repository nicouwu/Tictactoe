1. HOW TO PLAY:
Tic Tac Toe (aka noughts & crosses) is a classic game that dates back to antiquity: According to Wikipedia "Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE."

The objective is to get 3 of the same symbole in a row. Each player plays as either "x" or "o", and the first player to get 3 in a row wins the match.

To begin a game, click either one player to play against the computer, or two player to play against a friend. X's always plays first. For one player, the computer will always be O (therefore playing second).

At the end of a game, click the restart button to start a new game. The counters to the left and right of the board will keep track of player scores (games won). To reset the scores to 0, click either the one player or two player button.

Have Fun!

2. DEVELOPMENT
Technologies Used:
Html
CSS
Javascript
Planning:
i: Rough sketch - I started with opening a notebook and drawing a rough sketch of how my game would look. This included the game board, score counters, and buttons, and this process allowed me to visually map out all of the features that would requir styling and game logic.

ii: Basic structure - I created a basic game board with html and some css, simply to translate my sketch to screen and give me a basic visual model. There was no styling at this point, simply boxes making up the board and score counters, and basic buttons.

iii: Pseudo-code: I then started writing the pseudo code for the game logic. I didn't know where to start and so started with what intuitivelly came to mind - Creating x's and o'x on the board. This process inevitably brought to mind other aspects of would be required in the logic, and I continued this process until I had what I thought was a somewhat comprehensive map of what logic would be required in order to create a functional game.

Writing The Game Logic:
This process followed on directly from the pseudo-code. I simply started back at the top and started translating the preudo-code I had written into working logic.

Styling:

3. PROBLEMS:
a. FIXED PROBLEMS:
Player 2 was bugged and the win message would only appear after the next turn was taken. Problem was fixed by removing the for loop out of the if statement.
Getting the game to stop when a winner is decided.

b. PROBLEMS NOT YET SOLVED:
Haven't had a chance to get to styling the page.
Reset button is undersized.

4. CHALLENGES:
Writing accurate pseudocode - Thinking of all of the required game logic prior to starting the actual coding.
writing the statements for the win conditions
figuring out how to manipulate arrays mainly 

5. TOYS! (Features)
None yet.
6. LESSONS:
Naming things is the holy grail of good coding.
Thorough pseudo-code is paramount.
Adding features not considered in the original planning can cause nightmares.
Start with basic pseudo-code - Step by step of what the app does. Eg: 1st player makes a move, 2nd player make a move, repeat.
Do a brain dump at start of planning, and then organise the ideas.
